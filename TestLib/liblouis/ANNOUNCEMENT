The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.33.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release combines braille improvements with security enhancements.
We have new tables for Coptic braille, Cuneiform transliteration and for
Portuguese 6-dot computer braille. There are improvements to Dutch,
Hungarian, the International Phonetic Alphabet, Norwegian and UEB. On
the security side a lot of people have reported and fixed buffer
overflows and other memory issues.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

      Liu Yuwei
   -  Fix an overflow in ``passDoAction`` and ``doPassSearch`` thanks to
      Liu Yuwei

      Frees and Liu Yuwei.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Fix the back-translation of capital sign in Dutch thanks to Bert
   Frees
-  Major improvements to Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal
-  Improvements to the UEB table thanks to James Bowden. In particular
   the handling of words containing "somer", e.g. "Somerville" was
   fixed.
-  Hungarian improvements (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  Add a new 6-dot table for literary Coptic braille, thanks to Eric
   Harvey.
-  Added some missing symbols (including space) to the table for the
   International Phonetic Alphabet, thanks to James Bowden.
-  Add a table for Portuguese 6-dot computer braille, thanks to Tiago
   M. Casal and Iván Argote-Pérez. The table is based on the official
   documentation in Portuguese [4]_.
-  Add a new table for Cuneiform transliteration. It differs from the
   existing table ``cuneiform-transliterated.utb`` in that it does not
   adopt UEB dot patterns for the various diacritic marks. Instead it
   uses bespoke diacritics inspired by some IPA symbols. Thanks to Eric
   Harvey.
