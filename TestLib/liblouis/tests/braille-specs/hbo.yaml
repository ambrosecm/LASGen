  # The following tests show problems with the Hebrew writing
  # system. The problem with Hebrew is that it is written with a 4
  # stanza Unicode value. Hebrew is written with the 4 following
  # stanzas. 1 consonant, 2 dagesh which indicates pronunciation for
  # the consonant, 3 a vowel, and 4 a cantillation mark. Adding to
  # this complexity, sometimes these stanzas are presented visually in
  # the correct order for sighted readers, but in Unicode, this order
  # could be arranged in a couple of different ways. For example: 1
  # consonant, 2 dagesh, 3 vowel. Another way that is just as common:
  # 1 consonant, 2 vowel, 3 dagesh. This happens for several
  # reasons. Sometimes the arrangement is accidental, and other times
  # it is intentional. Sometimes this happens as a result of
  # converting one type of a document into another, such as a Google
  # document being converted into a Word document.
  #
  # For this reason, this test document presents portions of text
  # which evaluate all possibilities of the above mentioned order to
  # ensure correct and accurate braille, in every circumstance.
  # Further, the current Hebrew table does not reflect accurate
  # braille for the orders of the unicode stanza mentioned above.

  # These tests attempts to show how the current Hebrew table does
  # accurately produce the desired braille for the consanant, vowel
  # dagesh.

# Test for common Hebrew characters

# he-common-consonants.uti could serve as a basic building block for a
# modern Hebrew grade 1 table, whereas hbo.utb will add many more
# characters that are not relevant to modern Hebrew. The main
# differences between hbo.utb and he-common-consonants.uti.uti are the
# notes to the Masorah and the cantillation marks.
